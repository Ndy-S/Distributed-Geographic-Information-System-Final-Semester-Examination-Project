# Goods Lending Service Website with Google Maps Integration
This repository contains my University project, which focuses on implementing the Google Maps API within a goods lending service website. Although the project is somewhat dated, I’ve taken the initiative to create comprehensive documentation to ensure clarity and understanding.

## Project Scope
The primary objective of this project is to provide a platform for lending various items. Users fall into three distinct categories:
1. **User/Customer**: Regular users who borrow items.
2. **Admin**: Administrators who manage the system and user accounts.
3. **Courier**: Responsible for delivering borrowed items.

## Technical Details
- The website primarily follows a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) pattern for managing items, users, and transactions.
- Visual design takes a backseat in this project, as the primary focus lies in integrating the Google Maps API.

## Main Features Overview
The main login page features a custom Google Maps view, enhancing the user experience. This visualization provides a geographical context for the lending service, making it easier for users to locate items and plan deliveries.

The second image showcases an interesting feature of the Google Maps API: direction tracking. By leveraging this feature, users can receive real-time directions to their desired destinations. Whether it’s finding the nearest pickup point or navigating to a borrower’s location, this functionality enhances the overall usability of the lending service.
