# Map-based Lending Service
This repository contains my university project, which implements the Google Maps API within a goods lending service website. Although the project is somewhat dated, I have created comprehensive documentation to ensure clarity and understanding.

## Project Scope
The primary objective of this project is to provide a platform for lending various items. Users fall into three distinct categories:
1. **User/Customer**: Regular users who borrow items.
2. **Admin**: Administrators who manage the system and user accounts.
3. **Courier**: Responsible for delivering borrowed items.

## Technical Details
- The website primarily follows a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) pattern for managing items, users, and transactions.
- The visual design is not the primary focus, the emphasis is on integrating the Google Maps API.

## Main Features Overview
The main login page features a custom Google Maps view, enhancing the user experience. This visualization provides geographical context for the lending service, making it easier for users to locate items and plan deliveries.

The second image showcases an exciting feature of the Google Maps API: direction tracking. By leveraging this functionality, users can receive real-time directions to their desired destinations. Whether finding the nearest pickup point or navigating to a borrowerâ€™s location, this feature enhances the overall usability of the lending service.
